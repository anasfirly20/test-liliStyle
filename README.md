# HOW TO RUN THE APP

1. Run "pnpm i" to install all the dependencies
2. Run "pnpm run dev" in the terminal to run the app
3. Add another terminal and run "json-server --watch db.json --port 9000" for mocking the api and make sure its port 9000, because the baseURL in api.js has localhost:9000
4. That's it
